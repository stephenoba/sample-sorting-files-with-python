# Organize Photos

This is a sample repo of sorting files with python. Here,
a `Photos.zip` zipped folder which contains sample images
in the format `2016-09-04_Berlin_08:25:50.jpg`.

The `organize_photos.py` contains a script that sorts these
images into folders based on the location it was taken
which is gotten from the file name.
